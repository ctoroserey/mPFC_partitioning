@article{Meehl1986,
abstract = {In the papers prepared for the conference on which this book is based and in the discussion, there were some matters almost universally agreed upon but repeated unnecessarily. Then there were some things that should have been agreed upon but were not. Finally, there were matters that were not agreed upon that needed more intensive examination—matters playing a central role in the philosophy of the social sciences and in the present intellectual gloominess that seems to prevail in all of the disciplines represented.},

abstract = {Summary.—Null hypothesis testing of correlational predictions from weak substantive theories in soft psychology is subject to the influence of ten obfuscating factors whose effects are usually (1) sizeable, (2) opposed, (3) variable, and (4) unknown The net epistemic effect of these ten obfuscating influences is that the usual research literature review is well nigh uninterpretable Major changes in graduate education, conduct of research, and editorial policy are proposed},
