abstract = {Laboratory studies of decision making often take the form of two-alternative, forced-choice paradigms. In natural settings, however, many decision problems arise as stay/go choices. We designed a foraging task to test intertemporal decision making in rats via stay/go decisions. Subjects did not follow the rate-maximizing strategy of choosing only food items associated with short delays. Instead, rats were often willing to wait for surprisingly long periods, and consequently earned a lower rate of food intake than they might have by ignoring long-delay options. We tested whether foraging theory or delay discounting models predicted the behavior we observed but found that these models could not account for the strategies subjects selected. Subjects' behavior was well accounted for by a model that incorporated a cost for rejecting potential food items. Interestingly, subjects' cost sensitivity was proportional to environmental richness. These findings are at odds with traditional normative accounts of decision making but are consistent with retrospective considerations having a deleterious influence on decisions (as in the "sunk-cost" effect). More broadly, these findings highlight the utility of complementing existing assays of decision making with tasks that mimic more natural decision topologies.},
annote = {Rats foraged in an environment whose max reward rate possible was to always accept the shortest delays. Instead, rats were prone to non-optimally wait at longer handling times. This was best predicted by a standard rate model with an added aversion (A) term. Quit aversion (A) correlated with the nominal opportunity cost of time.},

abstract = {Regret can be defined as the subjective experience of recognizing that one has made a mistake and that a better alternative could have been selected. The experience of regret is thought to carry negative utility. This typically takes two distinct forms: augmenting immediate postregret valuations to make up for losses, and augmenting long-term changes in decision-making strategies to avoid future instances of regret altogether. While the short-term changes in valuation have been studied in human psychology, economics, neuroscience, and even recently in nonhuman-primate and rodent neurophysiology, the latter long-term process has received far less attention, with no reports of regret avoidance in nonhuman decision-making paradigms. We trained 31 mice in a novel variant of the Restaurant Row economic decision-making task, in which mice make decisions of whether to spend time from a limited budget to achieve food rewards of varying costs (delays). Importantly, we tested mice longitudinally for 70 consecutive days, during which the task provided their only source of food. Thus, decision strategies were interdependent across both trials and days. We separated principal commitment decisions from secondary reevaluation decisions across space and time and found evidence for regret-like behaviors following change-of-mind decisions that corrected prior economically disadvantageous choices. Immediately following change-of-mind events, subsequent decisions appeared to make up for lost effort by altering willingness to wait, decision speed, and pellet consumption speed, consistent with past reports of regret in rodents. As mice were exposed to an increasingly reward-scarce environment, we found they adapted and refined distinct economic decision-making strategies over the course of weeks to maximize reinforcement rate. However, we also found that even without changes in reinforcement rate, mice transitioned from an early strategy rooted in foraging to a strategy rooted in deliberation and planning that prevented future regret-inducing change-of-mind episodes from occurring. These data suggest that mice are learning to avoid future regret, independent of and separate from reinforcement rate maximization.},

abstract = {The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is a key hub of the brain's executive control system. Although a great deal is known about its role in outcome monitoring and behavioral adjustment, whether and how it contributes to the decision process remain unclear. Some theories suggest that dACC neurons track decision variables (e.g., option values) that feed into choice processes and is thus "predecisional." Other theories suggest that dACC activity patterns differ qualitatively depending on the choice that is made and is thus "postdecisional." To compare these hypotheses, we examined responses of 124 dACC neurons in a simple foraging task in which monkeys accepted or rejected offers of delayed rewards. In this task, options that vary in benefit (reward size) and cost (delay) appear for 1 s; accepting the option provides the cued reward after the cued delay. To get at dACC neurons' contributions to decisions, we focused on responses around the time of choice, several seconds before the reward and the end of the trial. We found that dACC neurons signal the foregone value of the rejected option, a postdecisional variable. Neurons also signal the profitability (that is, the relative value) of the offer, but even these signals are qualitatively different on accept and reject decisions, meaning that they are also postdecisional. These results suggest that dACC can be placed late in the decision process and also support models that give it a regulatory role in decision, rather than serving as a site of comparison.},

abstract = {Modern decision neuroscience offers a powerful and broad account of human behaviour using computational techniques that link psychological and neuroscientific approaches to the ways that individuals can generate near-optimal choices in complex controlled environments. However, until recently, relatively little attention has been paid to the extent to which the structure of experimental environments relates to natural scenarios, and the survival problems that individuals have evolved to solve. This situation not only risks leaving decision-theoretic accounts ungrounded but also makes various aspects of the solutions, such as hard-wired or Pavlovian policies, difficult to interpret in the natural world. Here, we suggest importing concepts, paradigms and approaches from the fields of ethology and behavioural ecology, which concentrate on the contextual and functional correlates of decisions made about foraging and escape and address these lacunae.},

abstract = {Sunk costs are irrecoverable investments that should not influence decisions, because decisions should be made on the basis of expected future consequences. Both human and nonhuman animals can show sensitivity to sunk costs, but reports from across species are inconsistent. In a temporal context, a sensitivity to sunk costs arises when an individual resists ending an activity, even if it seems unproductive, because of the time already invested. In two parallel foraging tasks that we designed, we found that mice, rats, and humans show similar sensitivities to sunk costs in their decision-making. Unexpectedly, sensitivity to time invested accrued only after an initial decision had been made. These findings suggest that sensitivity to temporal sunk costs lies in a vulnerability distinct from deliberation processes and that this distinction is present across species.},

@article{Hayden2011,
abstract = {Resources are rarely distributed uniformly in the environment. Food, water and other vital commodities more often occur in spatially local-ized and temporally ephemeral patches 1 . Patchy environments force animals to balance the benefits of staying in a depleting patch and leaving for a richer one 2 . According to the marginal value theorem (MVT) of behavioral ecology, animals should leave patches when their intake rate diminishes to the average intake rate for the overall environment 2,3 . Organisms as diverse as worms, bees, wasps, spiders, fish, birds, seals and even plants obey the MVT 3–6 . Ethnographic evidence demonstrates that human subsistence foragers also obey the predictions of the MVT in their hunting behavior 7 , and laboratory findings suggest that monkeys may do so as well 8 . The generality of the MVT solution to the patch-leaving problem suggests that the underlying mechanism is fundamental to the way organisms make decisions 4 . The neuronal basis of patch-leaving decisions, however, remains unknown. Building on recent progress toward understanding the neuronal mechanisms mediating perceptual decisions 9 , we hypothesized that the brain maintains a decision variable specifying the current relative value of leaving a patch. Conceptually, a decision variable is an analog quantity that incorporates all sources of information—in this case, reward size, handling time, search time and travel time—evaluated by the decision policy to generate a behavioral choice 9 . The hypoth-esized decision variable gives rise to a decision via comparison with a specific threshold. For simplicity, we assume that this process is analo-gous, although not necessarily isomorphic, to the neural integrate-to-threshold processes thought to mediate perceptual judgments 9–13 . We further conjecture that travel time between patches influences leaving decisions by changing the rate at which the decision variable grows, the threshold or both 10,11 . To test these hypotheses, we developed a virtual foraging task in which rhesus monkeys chose one of two targets. One target corresponded to remaining in the patch, and choosing it yielded a juice reward that declined each time it was chosen. The other target corresponded to leaving the patch, and choosing it yielded only a delay before the opportunity to choose again at a replenished patch. Monkeys' behavior closely matched the predictions of the MVT. We then recorded activity of neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cor-tex (dACC) while they performed the task. dACC has been linked to reward outcome monitoring and behavioral adjustment 14–16 , as well as to signaling reward outcomes and predicting changes in behavior 17–24 . Notably, ACC dysfunction attends clinical disorders that are associated with difficulty in abandoning maladap-tive patterns of behavior or cognition, including depression, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette Syndrome 25–27 . We found that dACC neurons responded each time monkeys made a choice and that these responses increased with time spent in the current patch. Monkeys abandoned a patch when neuronal responses reached a threshold associated with a particular travel time. When travel time between patches was high, the gain of neuronal responses with each decision to remain in the patch was smaller and the threshold for patch abandonment was higher than when travel time was short. Overall, neuronal response gain and threshold jointly predicted patch-leaving decisions. These findings suggest that dACC mediates patch-leaving decisions using a common integrate-to-threshold mechanism. RESULTS For each choice there were two options (Fig. 1a). Choosing the stay (short blue) target led to a juice reward in 0.4 s (handling time). The value of this reward declined by 19 µl ± $\epsilon$ (s.e.m., $\epsilon$ = 1.9 µl) each time it was chosen, mirroring the diminishing returns common to patchy foraging environments (Fig. 1b). Choosing the leave (tall gray) target led to no reward and a long delay that was fixed in a patch and varied},
