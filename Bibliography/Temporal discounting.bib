abstract = {The tendency of animals to seek instant gratification instead of waiting for greater long-term benefits has been described as impatient, impulsive or lacking in self-control. How can we explain the evolution of such seemingly irrational behaviour? Here we analyse optimal behaviour in a variety of simple choice situations involving delayed rewards. We show that preferences for more immediate rewards should depend on a variety of factors, including whether the choice is a one-off or is likely to be repeated, the information the animal has about the continuing availability of the rewards and the opportunity to gain rewards through alternative activities. In contrast to the common assertion that rational animals should devalue delayed rewards exponentially, we find that this pattern of discounting is optimal only under restricted circumstances. We predict preference reversal whenever waiting for delayed rewards entails loss of opportunities elsewhere, but the direction of this reversal depends on whether the animal will face the same choice repeatedly. Finally, we question the ecological relevance of standard laboratory tests for impulsive behaviour, arguing that animals rarely face situations analogous to the self-control paradigm in their natural environment. To understand the evolution of impulsiveness, a more promising strategy would be to identify decision rules that are adaptive in a realistic ecological setting, and examine how these rules determine patterns of behaviour in simultaneous choice tests. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of decision-making have generally related neural activity to objective measures (such as reward magnitude, probability or delay), despite choice preferences being subjective. However, economic theories posit that decision-makers behave as though different options have different subjective values. Here we use functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that neural activity in several brain regions—particularly the ventral striatum, medial prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex—tracks the revealed subjective value of delayed monetary rewards. This similarity provides unambiguous evidence that the subjective value of potential rewards is explicitly represented in the human brain.},

abstract = {A new experiential discounting task (EDT) is presented. Unlike existing question-based measures of delay discounting, which rely on imagined consequences during task completion, this EDT requires that participants experience choice consequences (i.e. delays and pseudo consumatory responses) during the measurement period. As a preliminary examination of this task's sensitivity to variability in discounting, 12 participants (six females) completed a timing test (production and reproduction), a question-based measure of delay discounting, and the EDT during non-sleep-deprived (awake 7 h) and sleep-deprived (awake 21 h) conditions. Based on evidence that sleep deprivation increases impulsive behavior, it was hypothesized that participants would underrepresent time intervals in both production and reproduction procedures and discount significantly more with the discounting procedures while sleep deprived. Unfortunately, data from the question-based discounting procedure could not be reported due to invalid task completion. However, as hypothesized, certain production and reproduction intervals were underrepresented on the timing test, and discounting was significantly steeper on the EDT when participants were sleep deprived. Also, rate of discounting on the EDT was better characterized by a hyperbolic function than by exponential function, which is consistent with previous delay-discounting research. These preliminary results suggest this EDT may be a useful measure for assessing state changes in discounting processes. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Subjects chose between pairs of hypothetical amounts of money available after different delays. When smaller, more immediate amounts were selected over larger, more delayed amounts, the addition of a constant delay to both outcomes resulted in reversals of preference, contrary to the standard discounted utility model of economics. The delays at which preference reversed were determined for three pairs of amounts ({\$}20 vs. {\$}50, {\$}100 vs. {\$}250, and {\$}500 vs. {\$}1,250). The relation between the delay to the larger amount and the delay to the smaller amount at preference reversal was well fit by both linear and quadratic functions. Intercepts increased with amount, strongly suggesting that rate of discounting decreases with amount. The presence of significant negative curvature in the data from the majority of individual subjects poses problems for exponential and hyperbolic models of temporal discounting in self-control, both of which predict a linear relation between the delays to the larger and smaller amounts.},

@article{Bixter2013,
abstract = {Decision makers often face choices between smaller more immediate rewards and larger more delayed rewards. For example, when foraging for food, animals must choose between actions that have varying costs (e.g., effort, duration, energy expenditure) and varying benefits (e.g., amount of food intake). The combination of these costs and benefits determine what optimal behavior is. In the present study, we employ a foraging-style task to study how humans make reward-based choices in response to the real-time constraints of a dynamic environment. On each trial participants were presented with two rewards that differed in magnitude and in the delay until their receipt. Because the experiment was of a fixed duration, maximizing earnings required decision makers to determine how to trade off the magnitude and the delay associated with the two rewards on each trial. To evaluate the extent to which participants could adapt to the decision environment, specific task characteristics were manipulated, including reward magnitudes (Experiment 1) and the delay between trials (Experiment 2). Each of these manipulations was designed to alter the pattern of choices made by an optimal decision maker. Several findings are of note. First, different choice strategies were observed with the manipulated environmental constraints. Second, despite contextually-appropriate shifts in behavior between conditions in each experiment, choice patterns deviated from theoretical optimality. In particular, the delays associated with the rewards did not exert a consistent influence on choices as required by exponential discounting. Third, decision makers nevertheless performed surprisingly well in all task environments with any deviations from strict optimality not having particularly deleterious effects on earnings. Taken together, these results suggest that human decision makers are capable of exhibiting intertemporal preferences that reflect a variety of environmental constraints.},

abstract = {Critical to our many daily choices between larger delayed rewards, and smaller more immediate rewards, are the shape and the steepness of the function that discounts rewards with time. Although research in artificial intelligence favors exponential discounting in uncertain environments, studies with humans and animals have consistently shown hyperbolic discounting. We investigated how humans perform in a reward decision task with temporal constraints, in which each choice affects the time remaining for later trials, and in which the delays vary at each trial. We demonstrated that most of our subjects adopted exponential discounting in this experiment. Further, we confirmed analytically that exponential discounting, with a decay rate comparable to that used by our subjects, maximized the total reward gain in our task. Our results suggest that the particular shape and steepness of temporal discounting is determined by the task that the subject is facing, and question the notion of hyperbolic reward discounting as a universal principle.},

@article{Jimura2013,
abstract = {A characteristic marker of impulsive decision making is the discounting of delayed rewards, demonstrated via choice preferences and choice-related brain activity. However, delay discounting may also arise from how subjective reward value is dynamically represented in the brain when anticipating an upcoming chosen reward. In the current study, brain activity was continuously monitored as human participants freely selected an immediate or delayed primary liquid reward and then waited for the specified delay before consuming it. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) exhibited a characteristic pattern of activity dynamics during the delay period, as well as modulation during choice, that is consistent with the time-discounted coding of subjective value. The ventral striatum (VS) exhibited a similar activity pattern, but preferentially in impulsive individuals. A contrasting profile of delay-related and choice activation was observed in the anterior PFC (aPFC), but selectively in patient individuals. Functional connectivity analyses indicated that both vmPFC and aPFC exerted modulatory, but opposite, influences on VS activation. These results link behavioral impulsivity and self-control to dynamically evolving neural representations of future reward value, not just during choice, but also during postchoice delay periods.},

@article{Massar2015,
abstract = {Making decisions about rewards that involve delay or effort requires the integration of value and cost information. The brain areas recruited in this integration have been well characterized for delay discounting. However only a few studies have investigated how effort costs are integrated into value signals to eventually determine choice. In contrast to previous studies that have evaluated fMRI signals related to physical effort, we used a task that focused on cognitive effort. Participants discounted the value of delayed and effortful rewards. The value of cognitively effortful rewards was represented in the anterior portion of the inferior frontal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Additionally, the value of the chosen option was encoded in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and cerebellum. While most brain regions showed no significant dissociation between effort discounting and delay discounting, the ACC was significantly more activated in effort compared to delay discounting tasks. Finally, overlapping regions within the right orbitofrontal cortex and lateral temporal and parietal cortices encoded the value of the chosen option during both delay and effort discounting tasks. These results indicate that encoding of rewards discounted by cognitive effort and delay involves partially dissociable brain areas, but a common representation of chosen value is present in the orbitofrontal, temporal and parietal cortices.},

abstract = {Gregorios-Pippas L, Tobler PN, Schultz W. Short-term tempo-ral discounting of reward value in human ventral striatum. J Neurophysiol 101: 1507–1523, 2009. First published January 21, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.90730.2008. Delayed rewards lose their value for economic decisions and constitute weaker reinforcers for learning. Temporal discounting of reward value already occurs within a few seconds in animals, which allows investigations of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. However, it is difficult to relate these mechanisms to human discounting behavior, which is usually studied over days and months and may engage different brain processes. Our study aimed to bridge the gap by using very short delays and measuring human functional magnetic resonance responses in one of the key reward centers of the brain, the ventral striatum. We used psychometric methods to assess subjective timing and valuation of monetary rewards with delays of 4.0 –13.5 s. We demonstrated hy-perbolic and exponential decreases of striatal responses to reward predicting stimuli within this time range, irrespective of changes in reward rate. Lower reward magnitudes induced steeper behavioral and striatal discounting. By contrast, striatal responses following the delivery of reward reflected the uncertainty in subjective timing associated with delayed rewards rather than value discounting. These data suggest that delays of a few seconds affect the neural processing of predicted reward value in the ventral striatum and engage the temporal sensitivity of reward responses. Comparisons with electro-physiological animal data suggest that ventral striatal reward dis-counting may involve dopaminergic and orbitofrontal inputs. I N T R O D U C T I O N Time is a theoretical but quantifiable construct that provides a common description for the unidirectional changes of suc-cessive states and events observed in the physical and biolog-ical world. Time is of crucial importance for biological organ-isms that rely on time-dependent resources. Temporal delays often reduce the subjective value of rewards. Underlying fac-tors include the frequent need for immediate energy supply of individuals, the uncertainty associated with temporal delays, and irrational and emotional factors associated with less tan-gible, distant rewards. The different reasons for temporal discounting have led to various concepts that range from the uniform reduction of subjective reward value by delays to the engagement of separate systems mediating the evaluation of immediate and delayed rewards (beta and delta dual processes) (Ainslie 1975; Kirby 1997; Laibson 1997; Lowenstein and Prelec 1992; Thaler 1981). Classic accounts of animal learning describe the lower efficacy of late rewards on learning (Hol-land 1980) possibly deriving from weaker value teaching signals. By contrast, situations involving the deferred con-sumption of reward require the decision maker to inhibit the natural impulse for immediate consumption, thus linking time to impulsive behavior (Ainslie 1975). Thus temporal delays appear to weaken reward value, engage particular cognitive and emotional processes and determine learning. Thus time appears to constitute a fundamental aspect of reward function, and organisms are sensitive to delays of reward when making decisions. Human neuroimaging studies demonstrate consistent re-sponses to reward in the ventral striatum (O'Doherty 2004). These signals reflect reward value by coding the quantity and probability of reward (Knutson et al. 2005; Preuschoff et al. 2006; Tobler et al. 2007b). Decreases of these signals with reward delays over hours, days, and months suggest that the coding may be subjective rather than representing the objec-tive, physical value of rewards (Kable and Glimcher 2007). Studies based on the concept of dual process discounting also describe stronger activations for immediate as opposed to delayed rewards (McClure et al. 2004, 2007; Tanaka et al. 2004; Wittmann et al. 2007), and individual differences in ventral striatum activation correlate with subjective prefer-ences for immediate over delayed rewards (Hariri et al. 2006). Temporal discounting is affected by lesions of the ventral striatum (Cardinal et al. 2001). Irrespective of theoretical assumptions and employed methods, these studies identify the ventral striatum as an important structure for processing tem-poral reward delays. Neurophysiological single neuron studies afford high tem-poral and spatial resolution. They report negative influences of delay on reward value signals in dopamine and cortical neurons in parallel with behavioral discounting (Kobayashi and Schultz 2008; Roesch and Olson 2005a,b; Roesch et al. 2006, 2007). These results are compatible with the concept of a single rather than separate temporal discounting systems. As routine inva-sive studies are only possible in animals, the knowledge gained from these studies should be used to interpret the human imaging responses. However, the experimental conditions of the human temporal discounting studies reported so far differed in several important aspects from those employed in animals. Most human discounting studies identified separate brain sys-tems mediating immediate and delayed rewards, except one investigation assuming scalar reward value coding (Kable and Glimcher 2007). Furthermore the reward delays of days, weeks, and months are well beyond the range of a few seconds used in animals, and even the shortest tested delays of minutes},
