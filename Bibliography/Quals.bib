abstract = {Many daily behaviors require us to actively focus on the current task and ignore all other distractions. Yet, ignoring everything else might hinder the ability to discover new ways to achieve the same goal. Here, we studied the neural mechanisms that support the spontaneous change to better strategies while an established strategy is executed. Multivariate neuroimaging analyses showed that before the spontaneous change to an alternative strategy, medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) encoded information that was irrelevant for the current strategy butnecessary for the later strategy. Importantly, this neural effect was related to future behavioralchanges: information encoding in MPFC was changed only in participants who eventually switched their strategy and started before the actual strategy change. This allowed us to predict spontaneous strategy shifts ahead of time. These findings suggest that MPFC might internally simulate alternative strategies and shed new light on the organization of PFC.},
annote = {MPFC (mainly dorsal and ACC, not subspecified) seems to be involved in exploration of environmental features that could drive strategy shifts. While the self-generated behavior switch was abrupt, mPFC coded information that resulted in this shift way before it became conscious.},

@article{Wikenheiser2013,
abstract = {Laboratory studies of decision making often take the form of two-alternative, forced-choice paradigms. In natural settings, however, many decision problems arise as stay/go choices. We designed a foraging task to test intertemporal decision making in rats via stay/go decisions. Subjects did not follow the rate-maximizing strategy of choosing only food items associated with short delays. Instead, rats were often willing to wait for surprisingly long periods, and consequently earned a lower rate of food intake than they might have by ignoring long-delay options. We tested whether foraging theory or delay discounting models predicted the behavior we observed but found that these models could not account for the strategies subjects selected. Subjects' behavior was well accounted for by a model that incorporated a cost for rejecting potential food items. Interestingly, subjects' cost sensitivity was proportional to environmental richness. These findings are at odds with traditional normative accounts of decision making but are consistent with retrospective considerations having a deleterious influence on decisions (as in the "sunk-cost" effect). More broadly, these findings highlight the utility of complementing existing assays of decision making with tasks that mimic more natural decision topologies.},
annote = {Rats foraged in an environment whose max reward rate possible was to always accept the shortest delays. Instead, rats were prone to non-optimally wait at longer handling times. This was best predicted by a standard rate model with an added aversion (A) term. Quit aversion (A) correlated with the nominal opportunity cost of time.},

abstract = {Distributed networks of brain areas interact with one another in a time-varying fashion to enable complex cognitive and sensorimotor functions. Here we use novel network analysis algorithms to test the recruitment and integration of large-scale functional neural circuitry during learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from healthy human participants, from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that promote learning. Our results reveal that learning induces an autonomy of sensorimotor systems and that the release of cognitive control hubs in frontal and cingulate cortices predicts individual differences in the rate of learning on other days of practice. Our general statistical approach is applicable across other cognitive domains and provides a key to understanding time-resolved interactions between distributed neural circuits that enable task performance.},
annote = {I like this as an approach to tract the development of networks. What they found is that as motor learning progresses, visual and motor networks retain their activity but connect less between each other. Individual's learning differences, however, depended on the degree of decoupling of non-motor/non-vision areas.

Good case for task-based functional connectivity vs RS.},
