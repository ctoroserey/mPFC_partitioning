abstract = {Given a connected graph G, it is sometimes desired to divide G into two subgraphs in such a way to minimize the number of edges which have one end vertex in each of the two subgraphs. There are multiple methods of accomplishing this. One method, proposed and proved by Fiedler, is called spectral graph partitioning. It involves using the Laplacian matrix associated with G and dividing the vertices of G into the two subgraphs by using one of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. In this paper, we restate Fiedler's theorem that the two subgraphs produced by this method are connected, and walk through Demmel's version of the proof in a straightforward way. Afterward, we examine small graphs and apply Fiedler's method to them to observe how his method effectively partitions the graphs.},

abstract = {Networks often exhibit structure at disparate scales. We propose a method for identifying community structure at different scales based on multiresolution modularity and consensus clustering. Our contribution consists of two parts. First, we propose a strategy for sampling the entire range of possible resolutions for the multiresolution modularity quality function. Our approach is directly based on the properties of modularity and, in particular, provides a natural way of avoiding the need to increase the resolution parameter by several orders of magnitude to break a few remaining small communities, necessitating the introduction of ad-hoc limits to the resolution range with standard sampling approaches. Second, we propose a hierarchical consensus clustering procedure, based on a modified modularity, that allows one to construct a hierarchical consensus structure given a set of input partitions. While here we are interested in its application to partitions sampled using multiresolution modularity, this consensus clustering procedure can be applied to the output of any clustering algorithm. As such, we see many potential applications of the individual parts of our multiresolution consensus clustering procedure in addition to using the procedure itself to identify hierarchical structure in networks.},

abstract = {The brain recruits neuronal populations in a temporally coordinated manner in task and at rest. However, the extent to which large-scale networks exhibit their own organized temporal dynamics is unclear. We use an approach designed to find repeating network patterns in whole-brain resting fMRI data, where networks are defined as graphs of interacting brain areas. We find that the transitions between networks are nonrandom, with certain networks more likely to occur after others. Further, this nonrandom sequencing is itself hierarchically organized, revealing two distinct sets of networks, or metastates, that the brain has a tendency to cycle within. One metastate is associated with sensory and motor regions, and the other involves areas related to higher order cognition. Moreover, we find that the proportion of time that a subject spends in each brain network and metastate is a consistent subject-specific measure, is heritable, and shows a significant relationship with cognitive traits.},
annote = {This is worth considering for the meta analysis (since they use HCP802): If the RS states can be temporally subdivided, then averaging through them could give us connectivity results that are not pertinent to DMN regions. Should we consider all of the resting state data during the connectivity analysis, or just focus on metastate 2 (cognitive processes)? I think focusing on metastate 2 makes more sense.},

@article{Monti2014,
abstract = {At the forefront of neuroimaging is the understanding of the functional architecture of the human brain. In most applications functional networks are assumed to be stationary, resulting in a single network estimated for the entire time course. However recent results suggest that the connectivity between brain regions is highly non-stationary even at rest. As a result, there is a need for new brain imaging methodologies that comprehensively account for the dynamic nature of functional networks. In this work we propose the Smooth Incremental Graphical Lasso Estimation (SINGLE) algorithm which estimates dynamic brain networks from fMRI data. We apply the proposed algorithm to functional MRI data from 24 healthy patients performing a Choice Reaction Task to demonstrate the dynamic changes in network structure that accompany a simple but attentionally demanding cognitive task. Using graph theoretic measures we show that the properties of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus and the Right Inferior Parietal lobe dynamically change with the task. These regions are frequently reported as playing an important role in cognitive control. Our results suggest that both these regions play a key role in the attention and executive function during cognitively demanding tasks and may be fundamental in regulating the balance between other brain regions.},

abstract = {A comprehensive map of the structural connectome in the human brain has been a coveted resource for understanding macroscopic brain networks. Here we report an expert-vetted, population-averaged atlas of the structural connectome derived from diffusion MRI data (N = 842). This was achieved by creating a high-resolution template of diffusion patterns averaged across individual subjects and using tractography to generate 550,000 trajectories of representative white matter fascicles annotated by 80 anatomical labels. The trajectories were subsequently clustered and labeled by a team of experienced neuroanatomists in order to conform to prior neuroanatomical knowledge. A multi-level network topology was then described using whole-brain connectograms, with subdivisions of the association pathways showing small-worldness in intra-hemisphere connections, projection pathways showing hub structures at thalamus, putamen, and brainstem, and commissural pathways showing bridges connecting cerebral hemispheres to provide global efficiency. This atlas of the structural connectome provides representative organization of human brain white matter, complementary to traditional histologically-derived and voxel-based white matter atlases, allowing for better modeling and simulation of brain connectivity for future connectome studies.},

Network analysis of human brain connectivity has consistently identified sets of regions that are critically important for enabling efficient neuronal signaling and communication. The central embedding of these candidate 'brain hubs' in anatomical networks supports their diverse functional roles across a broad range of cognitive tasks and widespread dynamic coupling within and across functional networks. The high level of centrality of brain hubs also renders them points of vulnerability that are susceptible to disconnection and dysfunction in brain disorders. Combining data from numerous empirical and computational studies, network approaches strongly suggest that brain hubs play important roles in information integration underpinning numerous aspects of complex cognitive function. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To date, many methods have been proposed, which are based on quite different assumptions. In order to understand in which way the results from different techniques can be compared to each other, it is useful to be able to formulate them within a common theoretical framework. In this study, we describe such a framework that is suitable for many of the dynamic functional connectivity methods that have been proposed. Our overall intention was to derive a theoretical framework that was constructed such that a wide variety of dynamic functional connectivity techniques could be expressed and evaluated within the same framework. At the same time, care was given to the fact that key features of each technique could be easily illustrated within the framework and thus highlighting critical assumptions that are made. We aimed to create a common framework which should serve to assist comparisons between different analytical methods for dynamic functional brain connectivity and promote an understanding of their methodological advantages as well as potential drawbacks.},

abstract = {Benjamini and Hochberg suggest that the false discovery rate may be the appropriate error rate to control in many applied multiple testing prob-lems. A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of prac-tical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the proce-dure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased.},

abstract = {In most natural and engineered systems, a set of entities interact with each other in complicated patterns that can encompass multiple types of relationships, change in time and include other types of complications. Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such ‘multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize ‘traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 the authors. The functional organization of human medial frontal cortex (MFC) is a subject of intense study. Using fMRI, theMFChas been associated with diverse psychological processes, including motor function, cognitive control, affect, and social cognition. However, there have been few large-scale efforts to comprehensivelymapspecific psychological functions to subregions of medial frontal anatomy. Here we applied a meta-analytic data-driven approach to nearly 10,000 fMRI studies to identify putatively separable regions of MFC and determine which psychological states preferentially recruit their activation. We identified regions at several spatial scales on the basis of meta-analytic coactivation, revealing three broad functional zones along a rostrocaudal axis composed of 2– 4 smaller subregions each. Multivariate classification analyses aimed at identifying the psychological functions most strongly predictive of activity in each region revealed a tripartite division within MFC, with each zone displaying a relatively distinct functional signature. The posterior zone was associated preferentially with motor function, the middle zone with cognitive control, pain, and affect, and the anterior with reward, social processing, and episodic memory. Within each zone, the more fine-grained subregions showed distinct, but subtler, variations in psychological function. These results provide hypotheses about the functional organization of medial prefrontal cortex that can be tested explicitly in future studies.},

Interestingly, pregenual ACC (our mPFC pocket) is not particularly tied to anything, so they stipulate that it works as an integrator (or hub, see van den Huevel and Sporns 2013). Overall, this paints a similar picture on vmPFC to Bartra, Acikalin, etc, but also contributes a wider spectrum of psychological features.},

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Activation of medial frontal cortex in fMRI studies is associated with a wide range of psychological states ranging from cognitive control to pain. However, this high rate of activation makes it challenging to determine how these various processes are topologically organized across medial frontal anatomy. We conducted a meta-analysis across nearly 10,000 studies to comprehensively map psychological states to discrete subregions in medial frontal cortex using relatively unbiased data-driven methods. This approach revealed three distinct zones that differed substantially in function, each of which were further subdivided into 2-4 smaller subregions that showed additional functional variation. Each individual region was recruited by multiple psychological states, suggesting subregions of medial frontal cortex are functionally heterogeneous.},

abstract = {Abstract Scale-free neuronal dynamics and inter-areal correlations are emergent characteristics of spontaneous brain activity. How such dynamics and the anatomical patterns of neuronal connectivity are mutually related in brain networks has, however, remained unclear. We addressed this relationship by quantifying the network co-localization of scale-free neuronal activity—neuronal avalanches and long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs)—and functional connectivity (FC) with intra-cranial and non-invasive human resting-state electrophysiological recordings. We first found frequency specific co-localization of scale-free dynamics and FC so that inter-areal coupling of LRTCs and propagation of neuronal avalanches were most pronounced in the predominant pathways of FC. Several lines of control analyses as well as the frequency specificity of network co-localization showed that the results were not trivial side product of brain dynamics or our analysis approach. Crucially, scale-free neuronal dynamics and conne...},

By comparing connectomes derived from simple to more advanced species, we identify two conserved themes of wiring: the tendency to organize network topology into communities that serve specialized functionality and the general drive to enable high topological integration by means of investment of neural resources in short communication paths, hubs, and rich clubs. Within the space of wiring possibilities that conform to these common principles, we argue that differences in connectome organization between closely related species support adaptations in cognition and behavior. In recent years, a growing number of connectomes of different species have been reconstructed, using a broad range of methodologies.These connectome maps are being examined using a common set of tools, principally drawn from the mathematical field of graph theory.Studies consistently report pronounced community structure, short communication paths, and the formation of hubs and rich clubs, features that appear to be universal across many species.Overlapping topological network attributes may reflect common themes of wiring of nervous systems.Differences in network architecture between closely related species may indicate specific adaptations in cognition and behavior.},

First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the trial sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems.

We created a common model of the human connectome using a new algorithm – “connectivity hyperalignment” – that discovers shared basis functions for connectivity topographies. Transforming individual connectivity data into the common model connectome dramatically increases intersubject correlation of connectivity profiles. More importantly, the common model connectome captures shared fine-scale spatial variation in connectivity profiles that is obscured by other methods of aggregating multi- subject data into a common space. We found similar results using fMRI data obtained in the resting state and while subjects watched a movie. Fine-scale variations in connectivity profiles are closely related to fine-scale distinctions in representations of information. These results reveal the existence of a shared fine-scale structure in the human connectome that was not incorporated in previous models.},

abstract = {Segregation and integration are distinctive features of large-scale brain activity. Although neuroimaging studies have been unraveling their neural correlates, how integration takes place over segregated modules remains elusive. Central to this problem is the mechanism by which a brain region adjusts its activity according to the influence it receives from other regions. In this study, we explore how dynamic connectivity between two regions affects the neural activity within a participating region. Combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in the same group of subjects, we analyzed resting-state data from the core of the default-mode network. We observed directed influence from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the 10-Hz range. This time-varying influence was associated with the power alteration in the ACC: strong influence corresponded with a decrease of power around 13-16 Hz and an increase of power in the lower (1-7 Hz) and higher (30-55 Hz) ends of the spectrum. We also found that the amplitude of the 30- to 55-Hz activity was coupled to the phase of the 3- to 4-Hz activity in the ACC. These results characterized the local spectral changes associated with network interactions. The specific spectral information both highlights the functional roles of PCC-ACC connectivity in the resting state and provides insights into the dynamic relationship between local activity and coupling dynamics of a network.},

abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) comprises a set of regions that exhibit ongoing, intrinsic activity in the resting state and task-related decreases in activity across a range of paradigms. However, DMN regions have also been reported as task-related increases, either independently or coactivated with other regions in the network. Cognitive subtractions and the use of low-level baseline conditions have generally masked the functional nature of these regions. Using a combination of activation likelihood estimation, which assesses statistically significant convergence of neuroimaging results, and tools distributed with the BrainMap database, we identified core regions in the DMN and examined their functional heterogeneity. Meta-analytic coactivation maps of task-related increases were independently generated for each region, which included both within-DMN and non-DMN connections. Their functional properties were assessed using behavioral domain metadata in BrainMap. These results were integrated to determine a DMN connectivity model that represents the patterns of interactions observed in task-related increases in activity across diverse tasks. Subnetwork components of this model were identified, and behavioral domain analysis of these cliques yielded discrete functional properties, demonstrating that components of the DMN are differentially specialized. Affective and perceptual cliques of the DMN were identified, as well as the cliques associated with a reduced preference for motor processing. In summary, we used advanced coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques to explicate behavior and connectivity in the default mode network; future work will involve applying this analysis strategy to other modes of brain function, such as executive function or sensorimotor systems.},

@article{Peel2016,
abstract = {Across many scientific domains, there is a common need to automatically extract a simplified view or coarse-graining of how a complex system's components interact. This general task is called community detection in networks and is analogous to searching for clusters in independent vector data. It is common to evaluate the performance of community detection algorithms by their ability to find so-called "ground truth" communities. This works well in synthetic networks with planted communities because such networks' links are formed explicitly based on those known communities. However, there are no planted communities in real world networks. Instead, it is standard practice to treat some observed discrete-valued node attributes, or metadata, as ground truth. Here, we show that metadata are not the same as ground truth, and that treating them as such induces severe theoretical and practical problems. We prove that no algorithm can uniquely solve community detection, and we prove a general No Free Lunch theorem for community detection, which implies that there can be no algorithm that is optimal for all possible community detection tasks. However, community detection remains a powerful tool and node metadata still have value so a careful exploration of their relationship with network structure can yield insights of genuine worth. We illustrate this point by introducing two statistical techniques that can quantify the relationship between metadata and community structure for a broad class of models. We demonstrate these techniques using both synthetic and real-world networks, and for multiple types of metadata and community structure.},

abstract = {Which principles determine the organization of the intricate network formed by nerve fibers that link the primate cerebral cortex? We addressed this issue for the connections of primate visual cortices by systematically analyzing how the existence or absence of connections, their density as well as laminar patterns of projection origins and terminations are correlated with distance, similarity in cortical type as well as neuronal density or the thickness of cortical areas. Analyses were based on four extensive compilations of qualitative as well as quantitative data for connections of the primate visual cortical system in macaque monkeys (Felleman and Van Essen 1991; Barbas 1986; Barbas and Rempel-Clower 1997; Barone et al. 2000; Markov et al. 2014). Distance and thickness similarity were not consistently correlated with connection features, but similarity of cortical type, determined by qualitative features of laminar differentiation, or measured quantitatively as the areas??? overall neuronal density, was a reliable predictor for the existence of connections between areas. Cortical type similarity was also consistently and closely correlated with characteristic laminar connection profiles: structurally dissimilar areas had origin and termination patterns that were biased to the upper or deep cortical layers, while similar areas showed more bilaminar origins and terminations. These results suggest that patterns of corticocortical connections of primate visual cortices are closely linked to the stratified architecture of the cerebral cortex. In particular, the regularity of laminar projection origins and terminations arises from the structural differences between cortical areas. The observed integration of projections with the intrinsic cortical architecture provides a structural basis for advanced theories of cortical organization and function.},

Dynamic connectivity in local networks is located in attentional areas during tasks and primary sensory areas during rest states, and dynamic connectivity in distributed networks converges in the default mode network (DMN) in both task and rest states. Importantly, we find that distinctive dynamic connectivity patterns are spatially associated with Allen Human Brain Atlas genetic transcription levels of synaptic long-term potentiation and long-term depression-related genes.

There is considerable interest in understanding how brain networks vary across individuals or neuropsychiatric populations or are altered during the performance of specific behaviors. However, the plausibility and validity of such measurements is dependent on the extent to which functional networks are stable over time or are state dependent. We analyzed data from nine high-quality, highly sampled individuals to parse the magnitude and anatomical distribution of network variability across subjects, sessions, and tasks. Critically, we find that functional networks are dominated by common organizational principles and stable individual features, with substantially more modest contributions from task-state and day-to-day variability. Sources of variation were differentially distributed across the brain and differentially linked to intrinsic and task-evoked sources. We conclude that functional networks are suited to measuring stable individual characteristics, suggesting utility in personalized medicine. Gratton et al. comprehensively measure individual, day-to-day, and task variance in functional brain networks, revealing that networks are dominated by stable individual factors, not cognitive content.

abstract = {The brain's functional diversity is reflected in the meso-scale architecture of its connectome, i.e. its division into clusters and communities of topologically-related brain regions. The dominant view, and one that is reinforced by current analysis techniques, is that communities are strictly assortative and segregated from one another, purportedly for the purpose of carrying out specialized information processing. Such a view, however, precludes the possibility of non-assortative communities that could engender a richer functional repertoire by allowing for a more complex set of inter-community interactions. Here, we use weighted stochastic blockmodels to uncover the meso-scale architecture of $\backslash$emph{\{}Drosophila{\}}, mouse, rat, macaque, and human connectomes. We confirm that while many communities are assortative, others form core-periphery and disassortative structures, which in the human better recapitulate observed patterns of functional connectivity and in the mouse better recapitulate observed patterns of gene co-expression than other community detection techniques. We define a set of network measures for quantifying the diversity of community types in which brain regions participate. Finally, we show that diversity is peaked in control and subcortical systems in humans, and that individual differences in diversity within those systems predicts cognitive performance on Stroop and Navon tasks. In summary, our report paints a more diverse portrait of connectome meso-scale structure and demonstrates its relevance for cognitive performance.},

abstract = {The human brain can be represented as a graph in which neural units such as cells or small volumes of tissue are heterogeneously connected to one another through structural or functional links. Brain graphs are parsimonious representations of neural systems that have begun to offer fundamental insights into healthy human cognition, as well as its alteration in disease. A critical open question in network neuroscience lies in how neural units cluster into densely interconnected groups that can provide the coordinated activity that is characteristic of perception, action, and adaptive behaviors. Tools that have proven particularly useful for addressing this question are community detection approaches, which can be used to identify communities or modules in brain graphs: groups of neural units that are densely interconnected with other units in their own group but sparsely interconnected with units in other groups. In this paper, we describe a common community detection algorithm known as modularity maximization, and we detail its applications to brain graphs constructed from neuroimaging data. We pay particular attention to important algorithmic considerations, especially in recent extensions of these techniques to graphs that evolve in time. After recounting a few fundamental insights that these techniques have provided into brain function, we highlight potential avenues of methodological advancements for future studies seeking to better characterize the patterns of coordinated activity in the brain that accompany human behavior. This tutorial provides a naive reader with an introduction to theoretical considerations pertinent to the generation of brain graphs, an understanding of modularity maximization for community detection, a resource of statistical measures that can be used to characterize community structure, and an appreciation of the utility of these approaches in uncovering behaviorally-relevant network dynamics in neuroimaging data.},

abstract = {Human functional MRI (fMRI) research primarily focuses on analyzing data averaged across groups, which limits the detail, specificity, and clinical utility of fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and task-activation maps. To push our understanding of functional brain organization to the level of individual humans, we assembled a novel MRI dataset containing 5 hr of RSFC data, 6 hr of task fMRI, multiple structural MRIs, and neuropsychological tests from each of ten adults. Using these data, we generated ten high-fidelity, individual-specific functional connectomes. This individual-connectome approach revealed several new types of spatial and organizational variability in brain networks, including unique network features and topologies that corresponded with structural and task-derived brain features. We are releasing this highly sampled, individual-focused dataset as a resource for neuroscientists, and we propose precision individual connectomics as a model for future work examining the organization of healthy and diseased individual human brains.},
annote = {This is pretty cool. By oversampling, they find some topological and topographical features that I found on my graph theoretic HCP analysis. Some highlights:

1) topology uncorrelated with cortical folding, but matches myelin (at least where they looked)

2) vmPFC has that non-DMN patch (they call it salient)

3) Modularity stabilizes at {\~{}}20 mins of data

While they seem to have done my job for me, there are some limitations here.

1) While they convinced me of subject-specific robustness, the amount of data they vouch for is a lot. It's clinically impractical to put a patient in a scanner for a total of 6 hrs. If I can get similar idiosyncrasies with a fifth of the data, then there is no need to agree to their extreme collection case.

2) Dynamics were not addressed. Namely, they still looked at overall activity per participant. Instead, we are looking at how the networks change over time. What we find is that the topological structure that they found is not stable within subject, such that it fluctuates as time goes by (1 hr data, 15 min sliding window). Importantly, the match between overall topology and dynamic network states was highest for windows that mostly consisted of inter-RS-session data. It's unlikely that the data would fluctuate so nicely across sessions. This could have biased their results positively.},

abstract = {Community detection in networks is one of the most popular topics of modern network science. Communities, or clusters, are usually groups of vertices having higher probability of being connected to each other than to members of other groups, though other patterns are possible. Identifying communities is an ill-defined problem. There are no universal protocols on the fundamental ingredients, like the definition of community itself, nor on other crucial issues, like the validation of algorithms and the comparison of their performances. This has generated a number of confusions and misconceptions, which undermine the progress in the field. We offer a guided tour through the main aspects of the problem. We also point out strengths and weaknesses of popular methods, and give directions to their use.},

abstract = {The fact that people think or behave differently from one another is rooted in individual differences in brain anatomy and connectivity. Here, we used repeated-measurement resting-state functional MRI to explore intersubject variability in connectivity. Individual differences in functional connectivity were heterogeneous across the cortex, with significantly higher variability in heteromodal association cortex and lower variability in unimodal cortices. Intersubject variability in connectivity was significantly correlated with the degree of evolutionary cortical expansion, suggesting a potential evolutionary root of functional variability. The connectivity variability was also related to variability in sulcal depth but not cortical thickness, positively correlated with the degree of long-range connectivity but negatively correlated with local connectivity. A meta-analysis further revealed that regions predicting individual differences in cognitive domains are predominantly located in regions of high connectivity variability. Our findings have potential implications for understanding brain evolution and development, guiding intervention, and interpreting statistical maps in neuroimaging},

abstract = {Resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is widely used to investigate brain networks that exhibit correlated fluctuations. While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics-high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2-12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.},

abstract = {Distributed networks of brain areas interact with one another in a time-varying fashion to enable complex cognitive and sensorimotor functions. Here we use novel network analysis algorithms to test the recruitment and integration of large-scale functional neural circuitry during learning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from healthy human participants, from initial training through mastery of a simple motor skill, we investigate changes in the architecture of functional connectivity patterns that promote learning. Our results reveal that learning induces an autonomy of sensorimotor systems and that the release of cognitive control hubs in frontal and cingulate cortices predicts individual differences in the rate of learning on other days of practice. Our general statistical approach is applicable across other cognitive domains and provides a key to understanding time-resolved interactions between distributed neural circuits that enable task performance.},

abstract = {Understanding functional connectivity within the brain is crucial to understanding neural function; even the simplest cognitive operations are supported by highly distributed neural circuits. We developed a novel method to measure task-related functional interactions between neural regions by applying coherence and partial coherence analyses to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Coherence and partial coherence are spectral measures that estimate the linear time-invariant (LTI) relationship between time series. They can be used to generate maps of task-specific connectivity associated with seed regions of interest (ROIs). These maps may then be compared across tasks, revealing nodes with task-related changes of connectivity to the seed ROI. To validate the method, we applied it to an event-related fMRI data set acquired while subjects performed two sequence tapping tasks, one of which required more bimanual coordination. Areas showing increased functional connectivity with both tasks were the same as those showing increased activity. Furthermore, though there were no significant differences in mean activity between the two tasks, significant increases in interhemispheric coherence were found between the primary motor (M1) and premotor (PM) regions for the task requiring more bimanual coordination. This increase in interhemispheric connectivity is supported by other brain imaging techniques as well as patient studies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C′. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only "sensible" criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.
